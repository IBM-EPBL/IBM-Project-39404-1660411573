<div id="content">
<p>Iam kaviya, living in Trichy. Iam currently studying for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering.
The reason behind choosing this track of study is, I strongly believe that there would always be a career opportunity when it comes to technology.
And I hope to become a Software tester rather than a Developer, as Iam not much into coding. Still, if I ever get a chance of working as a Developer, I will try to prove my worthiness to the company which hires me.
</p>
<p>Iam kind and keep the people around me at their comfort. Iam a film buff and I love watching horror movies, obviously that is what I do when I get free. Iam a music lover too and I love Yuvan's music and his voice a bit too much.
</p>
<p> That's all about me :)
